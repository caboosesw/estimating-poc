# estimating-poc

This is a dummy public repo to test out Github Projects, Waffle.io and Zenhub

# goals

* Create backlogs, WIP and ready for QA etc.
* Be able to estimate amount of work by sprint
* Be able to tie to billing
* Integrate with a light CI/CD workflow (TBD)

# notes

# zenhub

* what is a release vs. milestone?

# waffle

* waffle uses github labels
* estimating is one click
